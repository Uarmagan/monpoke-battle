# monpoke-battle

### To run Monpoke Battle:
`npm start ./file_name.txt`

Or you can use the sample file:

`npm start ./sample_input.txt`

### To run tests
`npm run test`

#### NOTE: I got close on this, but I couldn't figure out the turn based style of the game. Instead of taking longer on this I thought I would send you what I have.
